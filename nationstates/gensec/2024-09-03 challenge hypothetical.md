Open hypothetical, September 2024
=================================

Accept as given this hypothetical. Ignore the existence (or non-existence) of other resolutions. **Read this prompt in its entirety.**

A proposal makes the following claims:

> ...
> 
> ...

A challenge is brought against this proposal alleging ...

1. Identify the possible ways the proposal might be illegal under the ... rule. Such reasons need not be more than plausible on first glance.

2. Write a draft opinion disposing of the action and issues brought and reaching a conclusion as to the proposal's legality.

This [blog post](https://imperiumanglorum.wordpress.com/2024/03/23/writing-gensec-opinions/) may be helpful in detailing the structure and contents expected in a draft opinion. It may be useful to read recent opinions to get an understanding of their conventional structure and contents. Meandering opinions are hard to read and understand; consider outlining your opinion before drafting.

A test (also called a decision rule or formula) takes facts and compels a conclusion one way or the other on legality. If there are existing relevant tests, _cite them_ and apply them. If you believe the existing test is inapt, propose an alternative, justify that alternative, and apply it.

Tests are more specific than the overarching rule. An example follows. Within the veracity rule, there is a test for "omissions claims". This test, located in [2022] GAS 2 ¶¶ 3–4, specifies that "a claim that a target does not cover some topic... is not an honest mistake when the omission is 'very relevant' to the target's topic". The effect of this is to define what constitutes a plausible plain reading of the resolution. Tests are **not** just a repetition of the rule itself; they are tailored to the facts of the case.

Submissions will be evaluated on the following dimensions: 
* final decision correctness (illegal or legal);
* issue spotting (completeness and correctness);
* articulation of the test:
    * selection and statement of the correct test,
    * justification for the test that engages with precedent, and
    * correct application of facts to the test;
* quality of arguments and engagement with counterarguments; and
* opinion clarity.
