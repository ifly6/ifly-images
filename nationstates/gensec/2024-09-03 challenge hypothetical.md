Tips
----

This [blog post](https://imperiumanglorum.wordpress.com/2024/03/23/writing-gensec-opinions/) may be helpful in detailing the structure and contents expected in a draft opinion. It may be useful to read recent opinions to get an understanding of their conventional structure and contents. Meandering opinions are hard to read and understand; consider outlining your opinion before drafting.

A test (also called a decision rule or formula) takes facts and compels a conclusion one way or the other on legality. If there are existing relevant tests, _cite them_ and apply them. If you believe the existing test is inapt, propose an alternative, justify that alternative, and apply it.

Tests are more specific than the overarching rule. An example follows. One of the committee rule tests is given in [2024] GAS 4: "it is not a contradiction for committees to exercise the same powers or fulfil the same duties concurrently". This test is constructed to get the committee rule close to the facts at hand. The test needs to be justified with respect to the committee rule and precedent but is **not** just repeating the rule itself; it is tailored to the facts at hand.

Judgement criteria
------------------

Submissions will be evaluated on the following dimensions: 
* final decision correctness (illegal or legal);
* issue spotting (completeness and correctness);
* articulation of the test:
    * selection and statement of the correct test,
    * justification for the test that engages with precedent, and
    * correct application of facts to the test;
* quality of arguments and engagement with counterarguments; and
* opinion clarity.
