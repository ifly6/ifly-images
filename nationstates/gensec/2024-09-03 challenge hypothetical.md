Open hypothetical, September 2024
=================================

Accept as given this hypothetical. Ignore the existence (or non-existence) of other resolutions. **Read this prompt in its entirety.**

A proposal makes the following claims:

> ...
> 
> ...

A challenge is brought against this proposal alleging ...

1. Identify the possible ways the proposal might be illegal under the ... rule. Such reasons need not be more than plausible on first glance.

2. Write a draft opinion disposing of the action and issues brought and reaching a conclusion as to the proposal's legality.

This [blog post](https://imperiumanglorum.wordpress.com/2024/03/23/writing-gensec-opinions/) may be helpful in detailing the structure and contents expected in a draft opinion. It may be useful to read recent opinions to get an understanding of their structure and contents. Meandering opinions are hard to read and understand; consider outlining your opinion before drafting.

A test – also formula – is a decision rule which, given a certain set of facts, compels a conclusion one way or the other on legality. If there are existing relevant tests, _cite them_ and apply them. If you believe the existing test is inapt, propose an alternative, justify this alternative, and apply it.

Tests are more specific than the rule burden. Eg the test for "omission claims" within the veracity (= honest mistake) rule. Do not just repeat the rule burden.

Submissions will be evaluated on the following dimensions: 
* final decision correctness (illegal or legal);
* issue spotting (completeness and correctness);
* _explicit statement of_ and justification for the decision rule;
* correct application of the decision rule;
* extent of engagement with precedent;
* quality of arguments and engagement with counterarguments; and
* opinion clarity.
