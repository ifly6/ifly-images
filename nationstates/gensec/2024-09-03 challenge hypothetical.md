Open hypothetical, September 2024
=================================

Accept as given this hypothetical. Ignore the existence (or non-existence) of other resolutions. **Read this prompt in its entirety.**

A proposal makes the following claims:

> ...
> 
> ...

A challenge is brought against this proposal alleging ...

1. Identify the possible ways the proposal might be illegal under the ... rule. Such reasons need not be more than plausible on first glance.

2. Write a draft opinion disposing of the action and issues brought and reaching a conclusion as to the proposal's legality.

Tips and definitions
--------------------

This [blog post](https://imperiumanglorum.wordpress.com/2024/03/23/writing-gensec-opinions/) may be helpful in detailing the structure and contents expected in a draft opinion. It may be useful to read recent opinions to get an understanding of their conventional structure and contents.

A test (also called a decision rule or formula) takes facts and compels a conclusion one way or the other on legality. **It is explicit guidance as to the kind of proposals that are or are not permissible.** If there are existing relevant tests, _cite them_ and apply them. If you believe the existing test is inapt, propose an alternative, justify that alternative, and apply it.

Tests **are not** a mere restatement of the rule; they are tailored to the case's facts. For example, [2024] GAS 4 gives a committee rule test: "it is not a contradiction for committees to exercise the same powers or fulfil the same duties concurrently". Tests must be justified with respect to the rule and precedent. They slot in between the case's proposal and the rules, applying to a clearly defined class of proposals.

**State the test explicitly.** Consider bolding it. GenSec opinions offer guidance as to the kinds of proposals that people can and cannot write. Good guidance is easy for anyone to understand or apply. Good tests are the same.

Verbal meandering is obfuscatory: it reduces reader understanding and makes draft opinions harder to assess. Consider outlining your opinion before writing it. Cut unnecessary words.

Assessment criteria
-------------------

Submissions will be assessed on the following dimensions: 
* final decision correctness (illegal or legal);
* issue spotting (completeness and correctness);
* articulation of the test:
    * selection and statement of the correct test,
    * justification for the test that engages with precedent, and
    * correct application of facts to the test;
* quality of arguments and engagement with counterarguments; and
* opinion clarity.
