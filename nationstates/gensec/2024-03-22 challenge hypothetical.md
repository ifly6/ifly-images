Open hypothetical, March 2024 
=============================

Accept as given this hypothetical. Ignore the existence (or non-existence) of other resolutions.

A proposal makes the following claims:

> Capital punishment is cheaper than imprisoning criminals indefinitely and is more effective than imprisonment at deterring violent crime.
> 
> [GA 535 "Death Penalty Ban"](https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=38422136#p38422136) permits capital punishment under military law.

A challenge is brought against this proposal alleging honest mistake.

1. Identify the possible ways the proposal might be illegal under the honest mistake rule. Such reasons need not be more than plausible on first glance.

2. Write a draft opinion addressing the reasons why the proposal might be illegal that analyses whether the proposal is illegal. 

State the framework under which challenge should be analysed, the relevant tests that would be applied, and how the facts fit into those tests. Cite precedent *relevant* to your arguments.

**Read the previous paragraph.** Do not circulate responses to or request assistance in answering this question.
